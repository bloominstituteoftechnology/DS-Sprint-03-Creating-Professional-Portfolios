Your message:

Hi Brandon,

I see that you have a strong background and education in physics and research so I was curious how you feel that has helped you in your current data science position at Allstate? Do you find that your knowledge of physics has enhanced your ability to understand and implement large scale Machine learning models in the, mainly automotic, insurance industry? Would you recommend a prospective data sceintist have a strong background in the physical sciences in order to excel in the field? 

As a student in a data science program I feel that I will be gaining valuable insights into how models and algorithms work but would love to hear more about how you go about handling the massive data Allstate collects and how you implement these models and algorithms in a real world setting. I find it fascinating to hear how data is changing industries like insurance and how fast the data can be colelcted and used to make policy changes almost immediately. I would enjoy hearing your perspective on these things in person someday. 

Thank you for your time.

Brian Behnke
