Levi,

I came across https://healthcare.ai/ recently and noticed you founded it and I was incredibly impressed! I'd love to hear about it's success and how it has made an impact on healthcare in the US. 

I've been working on the payer side of healthcare the last few years and it seems to have very little impact on "improving healthcare" as they strive to do. I've been really interested in what Health Catalyst is doing and wondered if I could pick your brain on the company. I know you've recently left to go to Pluralsight, which is another company I'm interested in hearing about as well. Do you mind answering a few questions or would you be willing to jump on a call sometime to chat?

I appreciate your time!

Thanks,
Kailey Smith
