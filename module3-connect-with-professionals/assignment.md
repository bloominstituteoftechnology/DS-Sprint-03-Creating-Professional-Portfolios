Hi Cody,
I recently came across one of you papers, "Gas Turbine Machinery Diagnostics: A Brief Review and a Sample Application".  I am really facinated by the easily understandable 3-D plots, along with the discussion of machine learning as it relates to the turbine sensor data.  Just curious as to how you produced the visuals?  Seaborn?  

Most of my life, I have been facinated by data and recently decided to take a leap out of the sales world and pursue data science.  I noticed that we are both in the San Diego area and was wondering if I could take you out lunch and hear some of your insights and suggestions.

Does next Wednesday at Noon work for you?  I Noticed you work near Old Town.  Does the Mision Brewery work for you?  Thanks for your time and I look forward to meeting your.  Feel free to contact me by email or at 951-303-5165
