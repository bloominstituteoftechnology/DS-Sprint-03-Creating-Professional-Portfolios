### Draft 1 cold email or LinkedIn message to request an informational interview

Checklist:

- [x] Build rapport (with common ground and/or compliment)
- [x] Ask a question, such as: What’s a day in the life like there? / What are the biggest challenges you’re working on? / Would you be free for a 30 minute video chat?
- [x] Share your background, in 1-2 sentences. (No self-deprecation.)
- [x] Show enthusiasm! (But no desperation.)

Your message:

Hey, Joy!

It was really inspiring to see your profile up here.  The first part looks identical to mine, since I’m also an MIT BE alum that worked on genetic circuits (small world, eh? I was across the street in Ed Boyden’s group at the Media Lab). The second part is where I am right now, since you were at Insight and I’m at Lambda School. And finally, the third part is where I want to get to: a Data Science career based in SF. 

As I move into Data Science, I’ve been tempted to stay close to biotech because that’s where I come from.  You, however, seem to have moved entirely into a different sector.  Could I be playing it too safe?  I’d love to know what you’ve learned throughout this process.  Would you be free for a 30 minute chat?

All the best, 
Daniel
