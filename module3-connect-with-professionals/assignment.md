Mr. Jackson,

I recently got linked to an article on explore baduk where your project MiniGo was given a writeup and a look, and I have to say, it really inspired me.  AlphaGo was one of the things that pushed me to make a change in my life to studying data science, so seeing the project youve dropped a few hints about previously was very cool!  It's funny that it still can't read out ladders very well (according to the article at least), and gives me an excuse to look at your projects github and look around.  I would love to build something like this, or even just find a way to handle ladders!

I was also wondering what Google's culture in the data science field was like and what kind of projects/abilites that might go further than others in demonstrating ability/committment, as I am yet to have any experience but will be increasing my skills on the daily, as I am currently in a work heavy, time intensive learning program.  I would love to learn more if you have the time or inclination!  Thanks and happy late Thanksgiving!
