Hi Ashleigh,

I'm Crawford Collins, currently studying data science full time.
In the past I've worked in investments, but would like to transition to a new industry.

I saw on LinkedIn that you are a data scientist at Spring Venture Group. I'd love to ask you some questions about being/becoming a data scientist. 

Best regards,

Crawford
