Subject: Puppo The Corgi & Reinforcement Learning

Puppo looks absolutely so cute and amazing! I definitely feel reinforcement learning could have some interesting uses for game AI, and definitely think it could become a feature coming to some major games in a few years.

I want to know more about the science/math behind it, and was wondering if you had any recommendations for papers/blogs in reinforcement learning. I have only really started properly learning machine learning techniques in preparation for going from chemical engineering into data science, so any information you could give would be incredibly helpful.

Thank you again!
