3.Alison Lamano   https://www.linkedin.com/in/akimszal/  Alison has a very similar skillset to me. She's been a mentor for women previously and I'd love to be in contact with her. 
4.Joan Gelpi  https://www.linkedin.com/in/joan-gelpi-548224/ Joan is actually hiring data scientists right now and though I'm not quite ready for that, I thought it would be great to connect with him. He does have a PhD which is a tad intimidating but with my MS in Software Engineering, people don't discount me quickly.  
5.Kendra Clarke  https://www.linkedin.com/in/kendraclarke/ . Honestly, Kendra's picture has a smile that is contagious.  She and I have a mutual connection that also happens to be a good friend of mine.
