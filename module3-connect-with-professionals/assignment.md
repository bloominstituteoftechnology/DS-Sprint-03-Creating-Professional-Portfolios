Your message:
Hi Susan,

I'm currently in the beginning stages of learning Data Science at Lambda School, and would like to connect with a professional Data Scientist.  

I recently read your article **An End-to-End Project on Time Series Analysis and Forecasting with Python** and wanted to tell you how much I appreciate your work for introducing me to ARIMA model.  

The one thing I would like to know above all is what's a day in the life of a data scientist like?  Are data scientists given freedom to do their own research or are they given tasks by their employers on a project to project basis?  Do employers give data scientists opportunites to learn on the job?

Any advice you can give on how to grow into a real Data Scientist would be greatly appreciated.  Thank you for your time.

Sincerely,
Sammy Lee
