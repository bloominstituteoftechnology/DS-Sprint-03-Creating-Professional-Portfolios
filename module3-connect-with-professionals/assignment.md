Hello ,

 I follow you on LinkedIn and I admire your work, I have learned so much from you. You blogpost on  November data challenge was really inspiring and motivated me to stay engaged even if I cound not do all the challenges or too nervous yet to share it on LinkedIn. 
I’m looking into transition into a career in data science (I’m a web developer) . Would you be open to a Skype/zoom chat sometime? I’d love to ask about career advice and what technologies you recommend learning.

Best,
