Hello Lara,

I'm looking to connect with fellow data scientists in Houston. Your LinkedIn profile was very impressive to me. Particularly your description of being drawn to Data Science since it helps "work toward a greater good." This really touched me since the bulk of my background has been in the non-profit sector and would bring much meaning using my knowledge and skills towards positive initiatives.

Also I saw that you attended Springboard. I'm actually currently attending a similar program through Lambda School and after this I'm aiming to enter the Data Science field.

Would you have any advice on how I could continue to prepare? Also I would love to learn about what you do.

Thank you!
Carlos Gutierrez
