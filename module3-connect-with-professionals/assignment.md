I admire the way X, the moonshot factory focuses on world changing technology and bringing that tech to a point where it is commercially viable. Having recently sold my business I am transitioning from the startup life and I am focusing on my passion for data science. I’m currently in a 7 month, full-time, intensive Data Science program at Lambda School and I’m looking to connect with incredible data scientists like you in the Bay Area. I’m trying to learn as much as possible about what a day in the life of a Data Scientist is like at X.  Would you be free for a 30 minute video chat?
