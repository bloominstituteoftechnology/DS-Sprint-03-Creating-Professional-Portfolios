Considering the amount of money they may be getting paid. Sports forums are a fun place to watch the fan's consternation with players who they feel are under performing. Fans can be brutally open about their opinions. And yet many fans likely do not know the player's true worth to the team. Especially in aspects that may not relate to the final score of the game. \n",

I will leave that discussion and analysis for the next project. There I will determine player value without looking only at scoring. \n",
