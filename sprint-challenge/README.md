Your Sprint Challenge will go here!

Data Science Unit 1 Sprint Challenge 3
Creating Professional Portfolios

For your Sprint Challenge, you will write about your upcoming data storytelling portfolio project.

(Don't worry, you don't have to choose your final idea now. For this challenge, you can write about any idea you're considering.)
Part 1

Describe an idea you could work on for your upcoming data storytelling project. What's your hypothesis?
Write a lede (first paragraph)

    Put the bottom line up front.
    Use 60 words or fewer. (The Hemingway App gives you word count.)

This is hard, but you can do it!
Stretch goals

    Write more about your idea. Tell us what the story's about. Show us why it's interesting. Continue to follow the inverted pyramid structure.
    Improve your readability. Post your "before & after" scores from the Hemingway App.

The US is fairly evenly split politically. However, a map of states or counties colored by political party winner—red for Republicans and blue for Democrats—shows the vast majority of the map as red. Most of the red is in sparsely populated areas. Resizing districts based on population should give a more accurate picture of the political landscape.
Part 2
Find sources

    Link to at least 2 relevant sources for your topic. Sources could include any data or writing about your topic.
    Use Markdown to format your links.
    Summarize each source in 1-2 sentences.

Stretch goals

    Find more sources.
    Use Markdown to add images from your sources.
    Critically evaluate your sources in writing.

The above source shows an example of what I spoke about in the lede: even though Democrats won the majority of votes, the vast majority of the map is red.

https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/nov/08/democrats-republicans-senate-majority-minority-rule

This article mentions that Republicans won the Senate in the 2018 elections depite Democrats winning more votes. It points out that each state gets two senators regardless of population, and smaller states also tend to be more Republican.
Part 3
Plan your next steps

    Describe at least 2 actions you'd take to get started with your project.
    Use Markdown headings and lists to organize your plan.

Stretch goals

    Add detail to your plan.
    Publish your project proposal on your GitHub Pages site.

Actions to take to get started with project:

    Research how to plot a map.
    Plot a map of the US.
    Research how to resize subunits of map by population.
