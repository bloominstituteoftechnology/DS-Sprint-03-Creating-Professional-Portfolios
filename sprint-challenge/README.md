        "- More often than not, first time teachers chose schools near their hometown. This is causing a cycle of poverty in education where students from top school districts are likely to be accepted into univeristies with top Education departments. Then, upon, graduation, the new teacher is most likely to return to teach in their top school district. On the downside, teachers motivated to teach in low performing school districts are generally former students of the low performing school district. Two major schools of though have developed on how to break this cycle. The first is recruiting teachers from high performing schools districts to teach in low performing areas, the second is providing grants and special programs to students from low performing school districts that are interested in teaching in their community. My study will look at school districts that developed recruitment policies around one of these two solutions. I will be analyzing the effectiveness of these policy changes.
