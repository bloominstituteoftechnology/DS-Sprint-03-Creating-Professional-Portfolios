# Revise your writing assignment

Because my original medium post was in Spanish, I spent some time today starting a new post about one of my PhD projects.  Here is the introduction that I wrote, before and after editing for readability.

## Before Hemingway

Much of modern bioengineering is based on tools that bind to important biomolecules and execute some useful behavior, preferably in living organisms. The most famous biotechnology of the last decade, CRISPR, is based on a protein-RNA combination that can bind to (and therefore edit) specific sequences of DNA in the genome of basically anything.
While most research has focused on binding to DNA, there also exists an alternative approach focused on binding to the secondary genetic messenger, Ribonucleic Acid or RNA. Pumby is a programmable protein designed to bind arbitrary sequences of RNA in living mammalian cells.
While the full methods and results of this project was published in PNAS in 2016, this post is dedicated solely to the rationale behind the project and the most interesting applications that we envisioned for this new technology.

## After Hemingway

Biotechnology is all about attaching to important molecules and doing something interesting. You can attach Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) to anything and make it shine bright green. CRISPR can find specific bits of our DNA and make precise changes. That is how we can now correct the mistakes that cause many genetic diseases.
The most powerful molecular tools are programmable. Scientists can program the same CRISPR protein to bind almost any sequence of DNA. When you have a programmable tool, you only need to design it once. If you need a new behavior, you can change the program instead of making a new tool.
We created Pumby because we wanted a programmable molecule that could bind to RNA. Ribonucleic Acid (RNA) is a close cousin of DNA. The body uses RNA to make temporary copies of the instructions in DNA. Pumby is a protein that can we can program to bind almost any sequence of RNA.
You can find our full methods and results in our 2016 PNAS paper. In this post, I will explain why we decided to build Pumby and how it works.
